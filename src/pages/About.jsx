        My whole life I have been obsessed with puzzles. As a child, I would take on large jigsaw puzzles. I had a team of friends that would work on extreme challenges with me - the largest we completed was 18,000 pieces. In college, I turned to Sudoku, where I quickly became bored with the standard 9x9 sudoku challenges and sought out a "super-sodoku" of 25x25. These puzzles required additional tools to complete, so I created a "soduko-solver" using Excel that would help me solve them. Coding is the next puzzling challenge I am taking on, and I am excited about the road ahead.
